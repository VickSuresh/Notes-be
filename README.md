# Notes BE
## Backend for a notes web app.
Contains a REST API for saving notes locally, built in Typescript using Express and Node.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/VickSuresh/Notes-be.git`.
2. Inside the root folder, create a file called .env . Inside, write `PORT="your desired port"`. If this isn't done, the server will be hosted on localhost:8080. **This step is important**
3. Build the project with `npm run build`.
4. Start the server with `npm run start`.
5. Unit tests can be run using `npm run test`.

The frontend must connect to this backend for the app to function.
